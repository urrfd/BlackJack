# Blackjack Rules

## Objective
	
To beat the dealer by having a higher card total without going over 21

## Card Values
	
2 to 10 = Face Value

J, Q, K = 10

Ace = 1 or 11

**Note: The card suits are irrelevant in Blackjack.**

## Definitions
	

Blackjack = an Ace and a card worth 10 points (21 total)

Hole = the dealer’s card that is face down

Hit = draw another card

Stand = take no more cards

Bust = going over 21

## How to Play
	

- Players place bets by putting the desired number of chips in the circle in front of their seat.

- The dealer deals two cards face up to each player. The dealer receives one card face up and one face down.

- The dealer asks each player, in turn, whether they want to hit or stand.

- Base your decision on the assumption that the dealer has a card worth 10 points in the hole.

- Indicate that you want a hit by tapping the table or making a motion to beckon another card (as if motioning someone to “come on back”). Continue until you desire no more cards.

 **Note: Most casinos do not allow you to touch the cards.**

- If you don’t want a hit (or are finished hitting), indicate so by waving your hand back and forth face down over your cards.

- Once all players have made their decisions, the dealer reveals his hole card and hits or stands as appropriate.

- Payouts are issued based on the outcome.

## Winning
	

If your total is higher than the dealer’s (or if the dealer busts), you win.

## Payouts
	

- If you get Blackjack, the dealer pays you 3 to 2.

- If you and the dealer both get Blackjack, it is a push and no chips are given or taken away.

- If you have a higher total than the dealer (or the dealer busts), the dealer matches the amount of your chips.

- If you have a lower total than the dealer (or you bust), the dealer takes your chips.

## Doubling Down
	

You are allowed to double your bet after receiving your first two cards. You do this by placing the additional chips next to your original bet. If you decide to do this, you receive only one additional card.

## Splitting
	

If you receive two cards of the same number, you can split them into two separate hands. Do this by placing another equal bet alongside your first bet. The dealer will separate your cards and give you an additional card to make each one a complete hand by itself. You will then play each hand separately as you normally would.

## Insurance
	

If the dealer’s face up card is an ace, he will offer players the option of buying insurance. If you choose to do so you can then wager half your original bet (in addition to it) that the dealer does have Blackjack. If he does, your insurance is paid 2 to 1 but your original bet is lost (meaning you break even for the hand). If he does not have Blackjack, you lose your insurance.

## Even Money
	

If you have Blackjack and the dealer has an ace showing, the dealer will offer you even money for your Blackjack (instead of 3 to 2). If you do not take it and the dealer also has Blackjack, you will have a push just like normal.
